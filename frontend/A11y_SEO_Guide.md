To ensure accessibility, I used semantic HTML and Chakra UI components that support keyboard navigation and screen readers. I added clear labels to all form inputs and used aria-required attributes to indicate mandatory fields. Color contrast was improved using high-contrast combinations for readability. 
For SEO, I used react-helmet to set the page title and meta description to help search engines understand the content of the page.
